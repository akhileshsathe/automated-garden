# Automated Garden
### Introduction

The Automated Garden project aims to provide an innovative solution for plant care by automating the watering process based on real-time data from soil moisture and temperature sensors. By combining the power of Raspberry Pi, sensor technology, and Python programming, users can create a smart and efficient garden management system.
Traditionally, garden watering is often done manually or based on predetermined schedules, which may not take into account the specific needs of each plant or the prevailing environmental conditions. This manual approach can lead to overwatering or underwatering, resulting in poor plant health and wastage of water resources.
The Automated Garden system addresses these challenges by continuously monitoring the soil moisture levels and ambient temperature in the garden. The soil moisture sensor accurately measures the moisture content in the soil, providing crucial information about when watering is required. The temperature sensor helps in understanding the environmental conditions that affect plant growth.
